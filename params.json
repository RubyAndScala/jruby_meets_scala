Guard will also pick up changes in Scala as it watches for changes in `.class` files that SBT creates/overwrites on changes.\r\n\r\nSlides\r\n------\r\nThere are also some slides in the `slides` directory. They can be compiled into HTML by\r\n```bash\r\ncd slides\r\ngem install slideshow\r\nslideshow install impress.js\r\nslideshow build jruby_meets_scala.text -t impress.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe slides are precompiled and can be accessed [here](http://RubyAndScala.github.io/jruby_meets_scala/slides/jruby_meets_scala.html).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
